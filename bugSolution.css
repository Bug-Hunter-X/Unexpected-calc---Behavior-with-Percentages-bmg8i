There are several approaches to work around this issue, depending on the context. One solution involves using viewport units (vw, vh) instead of percentages. For example, instead of `width: calc(50% - 10px);`, you could try setting a specific width in pixels or using `vw` units and adjust the calculation accordingly. Another option is to refactor your CSS and avoid using `calc()` with combined percentage and fixed unit values if possible.
